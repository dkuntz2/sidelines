Just a list of thoughts/notes for future work/next intended work

- Move away from httpmock to creating a really basic http server and testing
  against that
  - The goal is to be able to actually test a proxy in a real way

- Request aggregator
  - Given a number of requests, print out the following statistics:
    - average RTT (needs to be added to sidelines.Request)
    - aggregate status codes (as in `200: 32, 404: 12`)

- "Floodgate"
  - Make X concurrent requests
  - Stop after Y requests
  - Stop making new requests after Z time
