# sidelines

(sidelines, as in where you go when you're benched)

sidelines will eventually be an http benchmarking tool. Intended support will
include going out through a proxy, getting an aggregate count of HTTP response
codes, setting a number of concurrent requests, ending the requests after a set
amount of time, or set number of requests.
